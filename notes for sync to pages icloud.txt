ravenous project part 2 summary: 

- moved business object from business.js to app.js
- create a businesses array that holds six references to the business object in App.js
- adds a businesses property to the <BusinessList /> component in render() method in App.js
- purpose of businesses property in App.js is to iterate through businesses array in App.js
- removed business components that simulate a list of returned business in BusinessList.js
- build functionality for the BusinessList component (in BusinessList.js) to iterate through the array and return Business components (BusinessList.js must import Business).
	- in BusinessList.js, inside BusinessList div, access the businesses prop and call the .map() method on it.
		- .map() method will create a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.
		- .map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.
	- this.props.businesses.map() 
		- accessing the business prop.
		- .map() method creates a new array as business
		- .map(business => { return <Business business={business} /> })
		- .map() business callback (call-later) function, then returns <Business business={business} /> to build (put-together) business objects.
- access Business information via the previously set business prop in BusinessList.js with this syntax: 
	- this.props.business.name
	- this.props.business.address
	- this.props.business.city

sets state: 
this.state = { mood: 'decent' };


read state: 
{this.state.mood}


update state: 
origin state: 
{
	mood: 'great',
	hungry: false
}

update state: 
this.setState({ hungry: true });

origin state updated to: 
{
	mood: 'great'
	hungry: true
}


call this.setState from Another function:
origin state: 
this.state = { weather: 'sunny' };
this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this)

makeSomeFog() {
	this.setState({
		weather: 'foggy'
	});
}

origin updated state to:
{
	weather: 'foggy'
}

===============================================================================================================================================================================
Build a Stateful Component Class, stateful component pass its state to a stateless component. 
To make that happen, you need two component classes: a stateful class and a stateless class

stateful parent class characteristics: 
- constructor
- sates
- returns: return <Child name={this.state.name} />; in render method.
- parent pass prop to child: <Child name={this.state.name} />;

stateless child, receiving state from parent: 
- child is going to receive a prop called name and display that prop on the screen
- access prop by: this.prop.name-of-prop in render method tags.

parent is going to pass prop to child.
that means that a <Parent /> is going to render a <Child />.

Example codes Parent.js:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Child } from './Child'


class Parent extends React.Component {
  
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { name: 'Frarthur' }
  }
  
  render() {
    return <Child name={this.state.name} />;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Parent />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);


Example codes: Child.js:
import React from 'react';

export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

===============================================================================================================================================================================
Child components update their parents state
1. parent component class defines a method that calls this.setState(). For an example, look in Step1.js at the .handleClick() method.
2. parent component binds newly-defined method to the current instance of the component in its constructor. For an example, look in Step2.js at the end of the constructor() method.
3. Once parent defined a method that updates its state and bound to it, the parent then passes that method down to a child. 
	For an example, look in Step2.js at the prop: <ChildClass onClick={this.handleClick} />

Example codes Step1.js:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ChildClass } from './ChildClass';

class ParentClass extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { totalClicks: 0 };
  }

  handleClick() {
    const total = this.state.totalClicks;

    // calling handleClick will 
    // result in a state change:
    this.setState(
      { totalClicks: total + 1 }
    );
  }
}

Example codes Step2.js: 
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ChildClass } from './ChildClass';

class ParentClass extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { totalClicks: 0 };

    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    const total = this.state.totalClicks;

    // calling handleClick will 
    // result in a state change:
    this.setState(
      { totalClicks: total + 1 }
    );
  }

  // The stateful component class passes down
  // handleClick to a stateless component class:
  render() {
    return (
      <ChildClass onClick={this.handleClick} />
    );
  }
}
